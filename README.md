18.065 Project - Skin Disorder Image Classifier

We are a group of undergraduate students at MIT in Professor Gilbert Strang's 
18.065: Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.

For our final project, skin-classifier, we are aiming to build a neural net
based classifier which can classify malignant versus benign melanoma which
may be hard to distinguish or know from an untrained eye. Moreover, we seek
to demonstrate how the disparity in accessible medical resources may impact
classification.
