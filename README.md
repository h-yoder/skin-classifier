18.065 Project - Skin Disorder Image Classifier

We are a group of undergraduate students at MIT in Professor Gilbert Strang's class,
18.065: Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.

For our final project, skin-classifier, we built a convolutional neural net
classifier which can classify malignant versus benign melanoma-- which, otherwise,
may be hard to identify nor distinguish from an untrained eye. Moreover, we seek
to demonstrate how the disparity in accessible medical resources may impact
classification integrity.
