18.065 Project - Skin Disorder Image Classifier

We are a group of undergraduate students at MIT in Professor Gilbert Strang's 
18.065: Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.

For our final project, skin-classifier, we are aiming to build a neural net
based classifier which can classify a few different skin diseases which
may be hard to distinguish or know from an untrained eye.
